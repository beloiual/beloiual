### Hi there, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹
#### My Current Endeavors
- I am a current Master's Student studying Computer Science and Engineering @ The University of Michigan. My focus area lies in Artificial Intelligence and Parallel Computing
- I just wrapped up my Software Engineering internship @ Palantir Technologies where I worked as a backend developer focusing on building out User-facing APIs and SDKs to enable complex data workflows for Palantir's Customers. My work has been a key selling point for the adoption of Palantir's Foundry product to certain customers.
- I just finished building [Aeglos.ai](https://aeglos.ai/) , a service that guards LLMs against Direct and Indirect Prompt Injection techniques. I published a [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/aeglos/) package and [documentation](https://docs.aeglos.ai/introduction) on how to use Aeglos and it's APIs to protect a system from attacks.
#### Previous Endeavors
- I previously worked at Ford Motor Company where I worked on the Ford SYNC 4 infotainment system to create the car's Virtual Keyboard which will be in future production vehicles serving Ford's customers.
- I also worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Robert Bosch LLC where I worked in the autonomous driving division (ADAS) to develop data analytics tools to process and visualize machine learning data.
- I was previously a researcher (the Lead of the Command and Data Handling Subteam) on the University of Michigan's Miniature Tether Electrodynamics Experiment. I worked on embedded programming and designing the computer architecture for the second iteration of our satellite. You can see a paper I co-authored here on recommendations for the second satellite (I wrote the command and data handling section) --> https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2021/all2021/249/

#### Links to Previous Projects
Check out my [DevPost](https://devpost.com/beloiual). I worked on two cool projects while at hackathons, Numoen and Heather AI. 
- **Numoen** involved deep research into the math swapping protocols in the blockchain space and creating a new trading function to hedge against impermanent loss. We ended up writing a [White Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12F46ti6imxkx1Gf4B2KNOvEnopPWo7RS/view) About it! Our team was able to win the best DeFi prize at our hackathon.
- **Heather AI** acts as your secretary, aiming to maximize your productivity and help you in your day-to-day life. You can chat with Heather to ask questions but the main purpose of Heather is to help you schedule your day. It essentially works like SIRI but better, allowing you to use your voice to automatically schedule events. Apple is adding support similar to what Heather AI does to SIRI in 2024.

Also, check out [Reverberate](https://taikai.network/en/ethchicago/hackathons/ETHChicagoHackathon2023/projects/clmmb7ila04wztn01bj8ij16j/idea). This project aims to make crypto investing more accessible to people who are new to DeFi, or to traders who want to easily explore strategies. We built an application that takes in a prompt describing a trading strategy and automatically generates code and backtests a trading strategy to evaluate its performance.  This was able to win a sponsor prize at EthChicago.
