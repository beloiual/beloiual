### Hi there, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹
#### My Current Endeavors
- I am a current Master's Student studying Computer Science and Engineering @ The University of Michigan. My focus area lies in Artificial Intelligence and Parallel Computing
- I just wrapped up my Software Engineering internship @ Palantir Technologies where I worked as a backend developer focusing on building out User-facing APIs and SDKs to enable complex data workflows for Palantir's Customers. My work has been a key selling point for the adoption of Palantir's Foundry product to certain customers.
#### Previous Endeavors
- I previously worked at Ford Motor Company where I worked on the Ford SYNC 4 infotainment system to create the car's Virtual Keyboard which will be in future production vehicles serving Ford's customers.
- I also worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Robert Bosch LLC where I worked in the autonomous driving division (ADAS) to develop data analytics tools to process and visualize machine learning data.
- I was previously a researcher (the Lead of the Command and Data Handling Subteam) on the University of Michigan's Miniature Tether Electrodynamics Experiment. I worked on embedded programming and designing the computer architecture for the second iteration of our satellite. You can see a paper I co-authored here on recommendations for the second satellite (I wrote the command and data handling section) --> https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2021/all2021/249/
