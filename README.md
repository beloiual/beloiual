### Hi there, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹
- I just wrapped up my internship at Robert Bosch LLC where I worked in the autonomous driving division (ADAS) to develop data analytics tools to process and visualize machine learning data.
- I am currently a researcher on the University of Michgan's Miniature Tether Electrodynamics Experiment. I am working on embedded programming and designing the computer architecture for the second iteration of our satellite. You can see a paper I co-authored here on recommendations for the second satellite (I wrote the command and data handeling section) --> https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2021/all2021/249/
